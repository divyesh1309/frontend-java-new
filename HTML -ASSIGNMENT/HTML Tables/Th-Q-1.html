    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th> Header 1</th>
                <th> Header 2</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>data 1</td>
                <td>data 2</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>


1. <table> :- The tag creates a table and holds all the rows and colume that make up the table.


2 <thead> :- The tag is used to group the header rows in a table, typically containing <th> elements for the column titles. It helps structure the table for better readability, organization, and accessibility.


3. <tr> :- The tag is used to create a table row, allowing data to be organized and displayed in a horizontal format.


4. <th> :- The tag is used to define header cells in a table, which provide titles for the data columns or rows. It makes the table more readable and accessible, enhancing the overall structure of the table.


5. <td> :- The tag is used to represent data or content within a table row. It helps in structuring the table by displaying the actual data corresponding to the table headers.
