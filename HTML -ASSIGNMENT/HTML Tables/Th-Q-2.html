Q 2. What is the difference between colspan and rowspan in tables? Provide
examples.

<!-- 

Difference between colspan and rowspan :- 


colspan :- 

-> The colspan attribute is used to merge multiple table cells horizontally, it specifies how many columns a cell should span. This is especially useful when you want to create headers or content that span across several columns, reducing the need for extra cells.

-> It is added to a <th> or <td> element.

    Example :-  if you want a header to span across three columns, you can use colspan="3" in a <th> tag to merge those three columns into one header cell.

    <table border="1">
        <tr>
            <th colspan="3">Header spanning 3 columns</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Data 1</td>
            <td>Data 2</td>
            <td>Data 3</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

Rowspan :- 

-> The rowspan attribute is used to make a table cell span across multiple rows. It defines how many rows the cell should extend into, making the cell vertically stretch over multiple rows.

-> It is added to a <th> or <td> element.


    Example :- if you want a cell in the first column to stretch over two rows, you can use rowspan="2". This allows the cell to span vertically, reducing redundancy and making the table layout cleaner and more readable.

    <table border="1">
        <tr>
            <th>Header 1</th>
            <th>Header 2</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td rowspan="2">Data 1 (spanning 2 rows)</td>
            <td>Data 2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Data 3</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
