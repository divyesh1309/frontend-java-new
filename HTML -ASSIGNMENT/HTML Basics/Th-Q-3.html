HTML? Provide examples of each.

<!-- 
Difference between "Block- level or inline/non-block elements"

In HTML, elements are divided into two categories, block-level and inline/non-block, based on how they behave in a webpage layout. 

1) Block - level elements :- Block-level element start on a new line and occupy the full width of their container by default, creating a structural block in the webpage layout.

Examples Block - level eliments :- <div> 
                                   <h1> to <h6> 
                                   <p> 
                                   <table> 
                                   <ul> 
                                   <li> 
                                   <form> ect.. 

2) Inline/non-block elements :- Inline elements do not start on a new line and only occupy as much width as necessary, allowing content to flow within the same line without breaking the layout.

Examples Inline/non-block eliments :- <img>
                                      <a>
                                      <span>
                                      <strong>
                                      <input>
                                      <em>
                                      <lable>
                                      <button> .
